1. Copy paste in your index.html
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template

2. In GitHub - your repo page  - Settings - GitHub Pages - Source - master - Save
Get the link and add it in Readme.md for LIVE PREVIEW feature.

3. Set app name (just get rid of Hello world).

4. Let's set a favicon. You can use any image, edit it with GIMP. Or you can
draw a favicon with: https://www.favicon.cc/ (I will do this.)
Just draw with your mouse and Download Favicon. You will have a favicon.ico file.

Create a folder "images", add your favicon here. Then, in <head> add:
  <link rel="icon" href="images/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />

5. Now, we need a layout. Let's see Bootstrap's docs.
  https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/overview/#all-in-one

6. Add custom css: a new folder "css" with "styles.css" in it.
   Add this under the css file from bootstrap in your html:
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">

  I set the body background with red and my container with white. I use this
  when I want to see something is working. Then I beautify the things.

7. Yes, let's set some nice colors. You can experiment with color palettes
from coolors.co. Just press Spacebar until you see something great. Then copy
the link:
  https://coolors.co/f92a82-ed7b84-f5dbcb-d6d5b3-7eb77f
I will add this in my css as comment. #f92a82 etc will be displayed with
colored background by my editor. So, I can see the colors in my code.

8. Now, use the colors. :) Experiment. Make sure there is contrast between text
and background.

9. Choose from Google Fonts. https://fonts.google.com/

10. Back to Layout. See grid system: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/grid/
  container -> row -> col
